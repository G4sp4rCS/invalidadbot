# InvalidadBot
Bot that sends cats on Telegram. Made in Go, powered by MicroCatServices only:
- [CataaS](cataas.com)
- [http.cat](http.cat)
---
## Okay, but how does it work?
The commands are intended to match CataaS' endpoints, which you can find [in this here URL](https://cataas.com/doc.html).
For example:
- /cat (Will send a random cat.)
- /tag tag_here (Will query a cat by its tag; tags can include spaces, and must be separated by commas.)
